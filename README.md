#### Problem Statement
We have gathered New York City's Central Park squirrel data over the course of 2 weeks. Using this data we will look into the observable actions of over 3000 squirrel sightings and determine whether or not we can use this observational data to smoothen squirrel-interactions for enthusiasts and the opposite.

#### Executive Summary
Our model data has found difficulty in curating an accurate model for analysing whether or not a squirrel will run away when approached given the contextual data of its actions, the time of day, and location.

#### Conclusions and Recommendations
We would not recommend applying any current human or mechanical logic to the prediction of whether we may approach a squirrel for closer interaction. We will use our current model to continue observing strong indicators of squirrel response and investigate these further.
